# Ethereum Registration Authority

Ethereum Registration Authorities (ERA) are entities which operate Ethereum
smart contracts which link organizations' blockchain identities, domain names
and real world identities. Domain names are linked to Ethereum accounts via
smart contracts. The linkage to real world identities is done by the ERAs
completing Know Your Customer (KYC) audits of organizations prior to listing them.

A key aspect of the ERA system is that organisations control their own information.
They can update their own information when and as they see fit. They can choose to
list with any or all root registration authorities, or become a root registration
authority themselves.

Applications that wish to use the ERA system choose which ERAs they trust. The are
able to iteratively search through delegate ERAs to find the domain specific information
they need.

## Example Usage

The diagram below shows an example of contracts used in the Ethereum Registration
Authority system.

In the example, there are two root registration authorities, **A** and **B**. Root ERA **A**
has an entry for example.com. Example.com is also listed in root ERA **B**. As such, applications
which need to access information about example.com or any of its sub-domains could use  
Root ERA **A** or Root ERA **B**.

Example.com operates a delegate ERA contract. It has two sub-domains listed s1.example.com and
s2.example.com. The entries for each sub-domain point to separate DomainInfo contracts which
hold the domain specific information.

Bank.co.uk is only listed in Root ERA **B** and does not operate a delegate registration
authority. Its entry in Root ERA **B** points directly at the DomainInfo contract for
bank.co.uk.

Supply.com operates a delegate ERA. It has a sub-domain aa.supply.com listed. This sub-domain
indicates the delegate ERA for its sub-domains is the supply.com ERA. As such, a1.aa.supply.com
and a2.aa.supply.com are listed in the supply.com ERA. Alternatively, a the sub-domains
a1.aa.supply.com and/or a2.aa.supply.com could have been listed in a separate delegate ERA.
Doing this would allow control of the sub-domains to be handled by a different group within
supply.com, such as a separate business unit. Both sub-domains a1.aa.supply.com and a2.aa.supply.com
use the same DomainInfo contract to store their domain information.

Edu.au could map to a government department of education that operates a
Delegate ERA. Each university, for example University of Queensland would
operate their own Delegate ERA, for example uq.edu.au. The university could
delegate the configuration of the Domain Information contracts to the
departments within the university. As such, the administrators responsible
for the domain itee.uq.edu.au would operate their own DomainInfo
contract.

An application could use the Finder contract (not shown in the example) to resolve
domain names to determine the DomainInfo contract to use for each domain.

## Expected Usage

The initial usage is envisaged as to be used for bootstrapping sidechains for use in permissioned
networks. This technology could be used for any situation in which blockchain information needs
to be tied to a domain name, each domain name holder should be able to control their information,
and where a central root registration authority is not desirable.

## Details of Contracts

### Overview

There are three sets of contracts:

- EthereumRegistrationAuthorityInterface and implementation(s): Root and delegate ERA.
- DomainInfoInterface and implementation(s): Key - value map of domain specific data.
- FinderInterface and implementation(s): Domain name resolver.

Each set of contract has an interface which applications should use. Implementations all return
version numbers. It is anticipated that there may in the future be new functions added. Applications
should be written such that they fetch the version number to understand which functions have
been implemented.

### Ethereum Registration Authority Interface

There are two main transaction functions:

- addUpdateDomain: Add or update the domain entry. Only the ERA contract owner can add a new
  domain listing. Only the domain owner can update a domain listing.
- removeDomain: Remove a domain entry. Only the ERA contract owner can remove a domain listing.

These functions and the getter functions take a domain hash. The domain hash is calculated as:

    ```Domain Hash = Kecak256(domain name)```

The following information is stored for each domain entry:

- Domain Authority: The address of the ERA contract which manages sub-domains, if such
  a delegate ERA exists for the domain.
- DomainInfo: Address of DomainInfo contract if such a contract exists for the domain.
- Domain Owner: The owner of the domain entry.

### Domain Info Interface

The DomainInfo contract holds a map of key - value pairs. Keys are generated from Raw Keys via `keccak256` algorithm.
Depending on API layer, Keys or Raw Keys are used in the API to set and retrieve values. Keys and Raw Keys are
case sensitive.

As a guideline, we recommend that Raw Keys are structured as follows:

`<DOMAIN-IDENTIFIER>/<DATA-TYPE>`

where `DOMAIN-IDENTIFIER` identifies the domain to which the information pertains to and `DATA-TYPE` identifies
the type of information stored.

#### DOMAIN-IDENTIFIER

Special wild card character `*` can be used as a catch all for default values in the entire DomainInfo contract.

Example of DOMAIN-IDENTIFIER could be

- `node.sidechain.example.com` to represent a side chain node.

#### DATA-TYPE

`DATA-TYPE` indicates the type of information stored in a value. Reserved DATA-TYPEs
are described below. Custom DATA-TYPEs can also be used. We suggest adhering to the guidelines described below.

Reserved DATA-TYPEs follow the following format:

`<RESERVED-TYPE-CATEGORY>:<RESERVED-TYPE-CLARIFIER>`

Following categories are available:

1. DNS keys - modeled after the
   [Domain Name System record types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types)
2. EF keys - keys specific to Ethereum Foundation

Complete list of reserved DATA-TYPEs:

| Reserved DATA-TYPE | Expected Value and Value Format                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dns:a              | IPv4 address as described in RFC 1035: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035 |
| dns:aaaa           | IPv6 address as described in RFC 3596: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3596 |
| dns:txt            | Text strings as described in RFC 1035: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035 |

User defined keys follow following format:

`<USER-DOMAIN>:<CUSTOM-TYPE-CLARIFIER>`

where REVERSE-DOMAIN is the reverse domain name ordering for the domain which creates the key and CUSTOM-TYPE-CLARIFIER
is a custom identifier string.

Examples of custom DATA-TYPEs:

| User Defined Keys          | Expected Value and Value Format                                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sc.pegasys.tech:enc        | Public encryption key / key agreement key for the Enterprise Ethereum node. |
| contact.pegasys.tech:email | Email address to use to contact the owner of the domain.                    |

Examples of Raw Keys:

| Example Raw Kes               | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pegasys.tech/dns:a            | The IPv4 address for pegasys.tech.                                            |
| \*/tech.pegasys.contact:email | The email address to be used to contact the owner of the DomainInfo instance. |
